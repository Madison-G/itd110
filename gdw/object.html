<h1>Object Elements</h1>
<hr>
You are somebody that I don't know<br>
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patr√≥n<br>
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM<br>
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out<br>
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out<br>
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"<br>

<p>The Line Break is used to force the line to go down so it doesn't completely jumble up. The Horizontal Line just makes a horizontal line across the page.
